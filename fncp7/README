Fncp7 <https://github.com/Earnestly/fonts/tree/master/fncp7>

  An iteration over FNCP6 with flat terminals and lower x-height.  This was to
  further experiment with hinting opentype fonts.

REQUIRES

  - fontforge <http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/>

    NOTE: This assumes at least fontforge 20141126-69-g036cd6e.
          Older versions may work but I don't test them.

    make
    mv *.otf "$XDG_DATA_HOME"/fonts

  Alternatively for a global installation:

    make PREFIX=/usr install
